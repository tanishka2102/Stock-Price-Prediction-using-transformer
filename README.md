# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-transformer
Deep learning-based stock price prediction using Transformer architecture with historical IBM stock data.
This project builds a deep learning model to predict stock prices using a Transformer architecture with Time2Vec embeddings, trained on historical IBM stock market data. The goal is to leverage sequential modeling capabilities of Transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies in financial time series.
#Features
 1. Data preprocessing & visualization
 2. Transformer-based architecture for time series forecasting
 3. Time2Vec embedding for better temporal representation
 4. Evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²)
 5. Predictions vs actual price visualization
#Tech Stack
 1. Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
 2. PyTorch / TensorFlow (whichever you used)
 3. Jupyter Notebook
#Dataset
IBM stock historical data from Yahoo Finance
