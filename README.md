# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Transformer

This project implements a deep learning model to predict stock prices using a **Transformer architecture** with **Time2Vec** features, trained on historical **IBM stock data**.  
The goal is to capture complex temporal dependencies in financial time series and make accurate short-term forecasts.
